## About:
A little about myself: I have Bachelors degrees in Accounting and Finance. I worked for 6 years as a financial analyst in both non-profit and private organizations. I then had a shift in careers and earned a Bachelors in Nursing and worked as a critical care Registered Nurse, with my end goal to work in healthcare to bridge my passions of data and medicine together. I am now about to graduate with a Masters in Data Science. 

## Projects: 

This repository contains my portfolio of data science projects.

Projects include: 
1.	Hotel Cancellation Prediction 
      This project predicts which hotel reservations will be cancelled. The data set comes from real life data.
2.	MLB Attendance Analysis 
      This project uses data on the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball (MLB) team. The data was explored and used to recommend to the Dodgersâ€™ management to improve fan attendance. Python was used for the analysis. I first imported the data, looked at the average attendance, then looked into the correlations of the different variables. Then created histograms of the different frequencies of the histograms. Then below that I looked at the min, max, and average attendance numbers for different types of games. Finally I had my recommendation to management.
3.	Movie Recommendation System
      This project uses the small MovieLens data set, to create a movie recommendation system that allows users to input a movie they like (from within the data set) and recommends ten other movies for them to watch. This project uses Python.
4.	Retail Revenue Prediction
      This project takes retail sales timeseries data, trains and tests the dataset and then builds a model to predict the monthly retail sales.
5.	Neural Network
      This project builds a convolutional neural network to classify handwritten numbers from the MNIST dataset.
6.	Movie Review Text Analysis
      This project uses TextBlob Sentiment Analyzer to analyze movie reviews as positive or negative. 
7.	Fuel Efficiency Prediction
      This project uses a linear regression model to predict fuel efficiency (or miles per gallon).
8.	DSC 680 Milestone 1
      This project uses classification models to predict the likelihood of fatality In if car crashes were to happen with certain conditions present. 
9.	Housing Price Prediction
      This project uses time series analysis to predict the average housing price of homes in or around the London area.
